# Project Cosmos

Cosmos is a comprehensive, AI-powered knowledge management platform
designed to transform unstructured information into a structured, navigable universe
of understanding.

The application allows users to precisely Scope their active knowledge base, then
leverage tools like Constellations to map relationships and build dynamic knowledge
graphs. Users can Query and explore data through customized Discovery
configurations, generate insights via Synthesize functions, and interact
conversationally with their data using the AI Interface. By applying robust Rules
and automation logic, Cosmos empowers users to manage complexity, extract actionable
intelligence, and master their collective knowledge efficiently.
